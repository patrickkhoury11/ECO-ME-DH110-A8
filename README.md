## Introduction / About this Project

This quarter's goal is to create a UX product that promotes one of the [17 Sustainable Development Goals](https://sdgs.un.org/goals) outlined by the United Nations. These 17 goals were adopted by all United Nation Member States and built on decades of work by countries and the UN, including the [UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs](https://sdgs.un.org/).  

The first step in any design process is to identify a problem. I did this by surveying the United Nations website, listing any goal I felt passionate about, and researching the current system in place to combat existing issues and reach the aforementioned goals. I felt strongly about Goal 11, Sustainable Cities and Communities, and could not find any existing comprehensive systems in place to combat . FIX THIS ONE

According to the United Nations, cities occupy just 3 percent of the Earth’s land, but account for 60-80 percent of energy consumption and 75 percent of carbon emissions. Inequality and the levels of urban energy consumption emissions are sprawling all suburbs all over the world.This has become such an issue that 9 in 10 people living in urban areas worldwide were breathing air that did not meet the World Health Organization’s air quality guidelines. By choosing to act sustainably, we choose to build cities where all citizens live a decent quality of life, and form a part of the city’s productive dynamic, creating shared prosperity and social stability without harming the environment. The cost of implementing sustainable practices in place is minimal in comparison with the benefits. For example, there is a cost to creating a functional public transport network, but the benefits are huge in terms of economic activity, quality of life, the environment, and the overall success of a networked city. All these issues facing sustainability will eventually affect every citizen. Inequality can lead to unrest and insecurity, pollution deteriorates everyone’s health and affects workers’ productivity and therefore the economy, and natural disasters have the potential to disrupt everyone’s lifestyles.

Traditional solutions to user involvement in sustainability efforts are all spread across different platforms that attempt to promote and inform environmentally-conscious actions. A myriad of options are available to users, but are difficult to utilize efficiently. For example: Facebook Marketplace exists for the purpose of helping individuals and businesses sell items locally, including used furniture and clothing. Clothing swap and thrifting applications like Depop and Poshmark exist primarily for the purpose of finding new homes for the items users once treasured and giving someone else's old treasures a new, happy home. The Green Globe program works with consumers, companies and communities to create sustainable corporate industries. Waze Carpool offers services where they provide rides for people to carpool with others in the area that are heading to similar destinations. Limitations with the current solutions include pervasive issues with visibility, efficiency, convenience, and high barriers to entry. Recent consumer insight research demonstrates that the public cares more about environmental issues now than ever before and feel personally affected by climate change. This growing increase in concern is stifled by a marked gap between aspirations and action, especially with those under age 30. 

My design would improve upon these issues by serving as a single platform to access these services, thereby addressing the gap between aspiration and sustainable actions by mitigating the aforementioned issues with services being spread across different platforms. Instead of having to sign up for a great many applications and jump between different platforms, barriers to access will be lowered by having this project as the one application that is the convenient, go-to for multiple services. With my centralized application, users will be able to more efficiently gather the information necessary to make informed, sustainable choices and pursue action with less time and energy spent searching for them. Furthermore, there is little education involved within these platforms, as the services themselves are sustainable, but users are not informed on the purposes behind these practices. My design will consolidate and improve on the aforementioned services while informing the consumer on sustainability practices. Finally, the single platform will also function as a social media application that allows users to expand upon their sustainability practices by joining a like-minded community and viewing events local to their area and that their friends and family express interest in attending.

## Design Statement and Community Contribution

This project will promote efficiency and convenience for user sustainability efforts by consolidating a variety of environmentally-conscious activities and services into one mobile application, presented as a social media platform. The aforementioned activities and services would be geared towards target users’ needs and daily lifestyle; for example, including carpooling, thrifting/clothing swaps, furniture repurposing, sustainability events, etc. In this way, my project will mainly support users in gaining an environmentally-conscious community and lowering barriers to access for information about related activities and services.

Based on the research I have conducted in the initial stages of this project, I believe that incorporating the following two key design features will mitigate the three barriers to sustainable living, as defined by previous interview subjects. The barriers are defined as:

* **Time:** “The world is full of a lot of people that are trying to do good on behalf of the environment but unfortunately are really busy. Having an intentionally sustainable lifestyle is something that takes up a lot of time to coordinate and keep going.”
* **Access to information:** “Lots of information about sustainability is tied up in academia and is not as accessible to the public, so it's more effort than it should be to learn about some of these issues and what the public can do to mitigate them.”
* **Inconvenience:** “People like buying clothes and other items and having to find a way to cut down on that can be off-putting.  When you're thinking about how to get from point A to point B and do it in a way that's good for the environment, it's difficult to bike or walk everywhere. If you need to get somewhere fast, a lot of the time driving is the best option. Ultimately, I think it's hard to try to be sustainable in a world where all of our systems and tools are more geared towards continuing the status quo.”

The two following features bring potential solutions to these barriers:

* **Consolidation:** Consolidating a variety of environmentally-conscious activities and services into one mobile application is far more convenient and time efficient for the users. This feature also mitigates the issue I identified in my previous evaluations stating the privacy concerns of the user. Users often don’t want to sign up their private information to multiple different service providers, as it makes them more likely to be susceptible to information breaches. This rids the user of the aforementioned concerns, while also creating a more time-efficient and environmentally-oriented product. Consolidating several environmentally-conscious activities into one platform allows for the opportunity to educate the consumer about sustainable practices and events, as the platform dedicates itself to the notion of sustainability and sustainable living in cities and communities.
> *Target user input on consolidation: “I would definitely prefer having one platform with multiple aspects and resources because it’s more convenient and time efficient to have everything in one place. I think with having one platform dedicated to sustainability also, I would be more inclined to remember to incorporate sustainability practices into my life because there’s now a platform where that’s the main focus.”*


* **Social-Media/Community Aspect:** Presenting the application as a social media platform directly pertains to the targeted demographic of secondary students and young adults with professional careers aged 25-29. Social media usage has increased nationally by almost 1000 percent in eight years (2005-2013) for people between 18 and 29, according to findings from the Pew Research Center. More than 98 percent of college-aged students use social media, says consumer insight service Experian Simmons. In addition, an annual nationwide survey of college students by UCLA found that 27.2 percent of students spent more than six hours on social media a week in 2014, up from 19.9 percent in 2007. 
* The targeted users make up the vast majority of individuals utilizing social media. These individuals actively seek activities and ways to be connected. Presenting the app as a social media platform incentivizes target users to be environmentally conscious, promotes activities and sustainable brands, allows for information to be presented to users, connects people who are existing or potential friends, and so much more. This feature stemmed from the recommendation of an interviewed target user.
* Users would have a profile page and the option to follow their friends and others. The app could employ ads from various environmental awareness brands, which would help generate revenue. This would aid both the brands (who are in support of sustainability) and the app itself (which would donate portions of its revenue to sustainability practices). Allowing location while the app is in use may allow for the details of relevant environmental activities in the user's area to be shown, encouraging the target users to go out and participate with their friends. These events may include but are not limited to beach cleanups, planting trees/gardens, and making/distributing sustainable products. Gofundmes, petitions, and other non time-draining commitments will also be available on the app.
> *Target user input on Social Media/Community based aspect: “I think to me, I would like to see information being made more accessible to the general public in terms and have an effort made to promote education around this topic. I also really would like to see a community aspect incorporated into the platform so that users can get in touch with people around them that are also interested in sustainability. And I think my last essential would be for the platform to have an optimistic point of view. I think that it’s easy to get really pessimistic really fast about the future of the planet, and I would hope that an application geared towards helping people become more sustainable has a more positive outlook on the future and help us with the steps we can take to get there.”*

## Competitor Analysis

### Heuristic Evaluation 

After defining my design problem and generating ideas for a solution, I analyzed the usability of competitor web/apps using Jakob Nielson’s 10 heuristics. The 10 heuristics are a foundational checklist that the majority of ux designers use in order to communicate the usability issues of a given user interface design. Nielson's 10 rules serve as general rules that seem to describe common properties of usable interfaces. These heuristics are often paired with ratings which evaluate the severity of usability issues. These can be used to provide a rough estimate of the need for additional usability efforts and aid in the process of allocating the most resources to fix the most serious problem. Furthermore, evaluating the strengths and weaknesses of my competitors' design will generate invaluable insight as I begin to create my own. 

### Jakob Nielson's [10 Usability Heuristics](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ten-usability-heuristics/) Explained

| Number | Heuristic | Description |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Visibility of System Status | Users should always be informed about what is going on and should be given appropriate feedback to their actions |
| 2 | Match Between System and the Real World | Use concepts and language that are familiar and logical to the user |
| 3 | User Control and Freedom | Allow users to make mistakes; give them options to undo and redo tasks |
| 4 | Consistency and Standards | Follow conventions and make sure design is consistent across the platform |
| 5 | Error Prevention | Get rid of error-prone conditions and provide users with safety nets for high-cost errors |
| 6 | Recognition Rather Than Recall | Minimize user's memory load by giving them suggestions and help in context |
| 7 | Flexibility and Efficiency of Use | Provide multiple ways to perform a task to make the platform accessible to all users |
| 8 | Aesthetic and Minimalist Design | Provide only relevant content and features |
| 9 | Help Users Recognize, Diagnose, and Recover From Errors | Tell users what the problem is and provide suggestions to fix it |
| 10 | Help and Documentation | Supply users with extra help to complete their tasks |

#### Takeaways from Website 1: [The Department of Economic and Social Affairs Sustainable Development](https://sdgs.un.org/)

The UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs (DESA) Sustainable Development website was not terrible by any means. However, the high standards I upheld for the intergovernmental organization were not met. There were several visibility of system status issues, mainly to do with the search bar. The website used unfamiliar wording and acronyms, and the site suffered from its many usability issues. Some of these issues include a faulty homepage logo, poor naviagation bar choices, no effective back button, etc. Perhaps the most pressing issue is the search bar suggestions. This issue is error inducing and quite frustrating. Not only does it recommend random combinations of numbers, symbols, and letters; but it also does not suggest anything remotely relevant to the topic of the website. Some of these issues could have been mitigated if the creators had implemented a HELP page of FAQ section, however this was not the case. 

#### Takeaways from Website 2: [Global Platform for Sustainable Cities](https://www.thegpsc.org/)

The Global Platform for Sustainable Cities website functions as a key platform to bring together subject matter experts and partner cities that are striving towards improving urban sustainability. It is very apparent on the site that the organization is made up of a vast number of diverse individuals from different backgrounds and locations, which is a strength to their mission, but might manifest in damaging ways to the overall usability of the platform. Ultimately, users are presented with a website that is passable in most user heuristic regards, but performs poorly when it comes to issues of Error Prevention and Error Recognition, Diagnosis, and Recovery; Flexibility and Efficiency of Use; Aesthetic and Minimalist Design; and Help and Documentation. Key concerns within these categories relate to issues with the search bar and newsletter subscription mechanisms, as well as to a design that detracts from usability of the site. For all of its great content, the site lacks proper mechanisms for users to navigate freely and access help should they need it. The Global Platform for Sustainable Cities should focus on simplifying design choices to prioritize readability and revamp the search bar, newsletter subscription box, and implement a help section to improve the site’s utility. All in all, the content of the site is great, but improvements need to be made to guarantee users are able to fully appreciate the vast amount of information provided. 

#### Takeaways from Website 3: [Yale University Art School](https://www.art.yale.edu/)

I conducted an additional anaylysis of the Yale School of Art website. The Yale School of Art website purports to be an “ongoing collaborative experiment in digital publishing and information sharing” by existing as a wiki-esque site that can be edited by any member of the community. This is perhaps the most useful website I analyzed, as evaluating the usability of its collaborative properties are invaluable in creating my collaborative application.

Though this experiment is certainly impressive and makes a bold statement to users that come across the site, the mis-matched nature of the website ultimately detracts from its usability in a variety of ways. Key issues within Visibility of System Status, Consistency and Standards, and Aesthetic and Minimalist Design usability heuristics for user interface design all point to issues with the site being too busy and disorganized. The site pages lack clear navigation and information grouping that makes it difficult to have a clear, consistent user experience. Instead, coupled with error message issues, the site becomes difficult and frustrating to use to access information. The Yale School of Art should focus key improvements to centralize on a core design and more organized information, simplifying the site to ensure that users are able to more easily navigate it without being overwhelmed or distracted.

## Usability Testing

The purpose of Usability Testing (UT) is to identify possible pain points of the tested product/design, and consider the thoughts and difficulties of the user to be able to assess the efficiency, effectiveness, and satisfaction of the product or design. Effectiveness is measured through accuracy and completeness with which users achieve specified goals. Efficiency is determined by the time and resources expended in relation to the accuracy and completeness with which users achieve goals. Finally, satisfaction is measured through a Likert scale where the participant grades his/her attitudes and comfort levels towards the product, whether it be positive or negative. The core of ux design is design for the user. Inherently, testing the product/design with the users is crucial. UT serves a variety of purposes such as informing design, eliminating frustration, and improving profitability. It helps the creator identify design/product issues, while directing them to allocate the proper amount of resources proportional to the severity of the issue. Furthermore, it reduces the costs of servicing the design/product. It is always better to do a UT test rather than nothing, as the benefits are immense. I will be conducting a UT, testing my participant on the highest severity issues in the heuristic evaluation I conducted last week, of The Department of Economic and Social Affairs (from now on I'll abbreviate to DESA) Sustainable Development website ( https://sdgs.un.org/ ). I will do so by asking the user to complete three tasks and hopefully uncover the issues I determined with the website in the heuristic evaluation last week. I will ask the user a variety of different questions and record insight while he/she is participating in the UT.

Severe usability issues I found within the DESA Sustainable Develepment site from my heuristic evaluation:
- Faulty Search Bar
- No Help Page/FAQ
- Inconsistent Pages
- Gap in Match Between System and the Real World

## UX Storytelling - User Personas & Scenarios

UX storytelling is a vital process within an iterative and holistic approach towards human centered design. Through patterns that I have discovered in the aforementioned sections of analysis, I have gained compelling insights that will aid me generate ideas and build prototypes to improve the design and functionality of my product. It will allow me to shift my perspective into that of the user and clearly communicate their critiques and desires. Furthermore, it will allow me to filter any biases I may carry subconsciously, as instead of basing these functions on my own ideas, I am basing them off the suggestions from my targeted users. 

During my research, I created two personas based upon the two key design features I highlighted earlier (Consolidation and Social-Media/Community Aspect). These features bring potential solutions to the three barriers to sustainable living, as defined by previous interview subjects.

#### Alex - The New Kid

## Low-FIdelity Prototype:

Low-fidelity prototypes are helpful in enabling early visualization of alternative design solutions, which helps provoke innovation and improvement. Low-fidelity prototypes translate high-level design concepts into testable artifacts, and are especially useful in the early stages in the design process. Low-fidelity testing is always beneficial in the design process, as it is inexpensive, fast, collaborative, and clarifying. Improvements to these prototypes can be made very easily, and users often feel most comfortable suggesting changes during this time, as the product is not yet finished and development hasn’t been completed. Creators can easily iterate the product in real time, as parts of the design can be quickly redone in a few minutes based on consumer comments. The following wireframes will serve as the initial prototype of my product. Through user interactions, it will allow me to begin working through how exactly the user will interact with the application that I am designing and give me insightful feedback on how to optimize this process.

### Wireframes
The following wireframes (pdf version linked [here](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/114698093/199420376-5efaf300-243d-408d-8975-b2fc1b30b94e.png) serve as the foundation of the application. The five wireframes below represent the five main naviagtion tabs within the application. These wireframes are the hub of all naviagtion and task completion within the app.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/114698093/199420376-5efaf300-243d-408d-8975-b2fc1b30b94e.png)

*From left to right:*
* Home page: This is the page where all posts from accounts the user follows will appear. Furthermore, environmental facts will appear on this page. The user may search for accounts, direct message other users, turn on/off post notifications, and create posts from  this page.
* Shop: This is where the user can buy or sell second-hand or refurbished items. The user can search for or save any particular items they like. They may also leave reviews for items they have bought.
* Rides: This is where the user can carpool or commute group to a destination. Carpooling is used to get from Point A to Point B whenever the user needs. Commute groups are used for recurring rides to work, school, or wherever else the user's commute might take them. 
* Events: This is where the user can create or sign up for environmental events. Users are able to save events, invite their friends, or get any additional information they may need in this page. There is also a search and filter feature available.
* Profile: This is where the user can view or edit how their profile looks to others utilizing the app. Users' profile picture, bio, link, posts, etc are all present in this page. 

### Persona-Based Tasks
I created two personas in the previous assignment based on my findings from my interviews and analysis. The story of each persona from the previous step will be presented below. I also created key scenarios which illustrate a different activity/task to accomplish a feature inspired by the users’ personas. 

#### Task 1:
* Alex needs a cheap desk for his apartment after living life in the dorms his freshman year. Alex would like his desk to be second-hand, as his roommate Noah is passionate about sustainable living. Alex does not own a car, so he would like the desk to be in a 5 mile radius from UCSD.

### Initial Wireframe applied in Wireflow 1, Task 1

*Flow Description:* The flow intends for the user to navigate to the shop screen from the home page. Next, the user would have to hit the "Search for anything" button. The user would then search the term "Used desk". After getting to the results page, the user would filter their results by hitting the "Filter" button. They would hit the "Distance" button on the filter menu. Next the user would slide the distance bar to up to 5 miles. The user would then select the "View Items" button. After that, the user would select the item and hit the "Add to Bag" button.

Test User Wireflow 1, Task 1:
![wfr1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/114698093/199508800-d662d9b3-335e-401f-811e-c439ddcd915f.png)


Valuable Feedback from the user:
* "I think it would be more clear if the ends of the bar were labeled "Min" and "Max" or something along those lines. Might also be helpful to have preset mile notches in the bar (like 5, 25, 50, 100 miles) because I don't know how "up to 5 miles" pops up." 

* "When following the recommendation tool, the user was hesitant to filter and sort by ratings. The feature was intended for the user to select specific ratings, for example, only ratings with a 4/5 and 5/5 rating. With this understanding, the user decided not to sort by rating because she wanted to look at all ratings, regardless of how they scored the hotel. After testing, the user asked me if this was the correct interpretation. Additionally, after pressing **Done**, the user expected to return to the list of reviews. The flow instead returned to the information about the hotel. This was an error on my part in how I designed the flow."

## High-Fidelity Prototype:

Functioning high-fidelity prototypes serve the purpose of presenting a clear and close representation of the user interface expected in the final version of the product. Conducting testing on the functions and appearance of this prototype allows for necessary feedback. This feedback could catalyze last minute adjustments, validate the effectiveness of the product, or prevent the product from being released due to performance errors. Testing high-fidelity prototypes demonstrate the amount of time users may need to complete each task supported. High-fidelity prototypes offer many pros with very limited cons, thus they are very beneficial to whomever chooses to utilize them.

  - Includes test screens, final iterations, digitized wireframes and wireflow, color contrast check, color wheel, and saved color and text styles.



### Interactive High-Fidelity Prototype

I created two interactive prototypes supported by the system. These prototypes were of the tasks previously discussed in the Persona-based tasks section.

Task 1: Shop for a second-hand desk within a 5 mile radius
- You need a cheap desk for your apartment after living life in the dorms your freshman year. You would like the desk to be second-hand, as your roommate Noah is passionate about sustainable living. You do not own a car, so you would like the desk to be in a 5 mile radius from UCSD.

## Evaluation and Revision:

High-fidelity prototypes to convert the previously created low-fidelity designs into a digitized design with carefully selected graphic variations (i.e. typographic variation, shape variation, color variation, etc). Furthermore, graphic principles such as readability, user comprehension, and general accessibility were also prioritized in this process. The process of digitizing my low-fidelity design was done through the online interface design tool, Figma. The dimensions of the frames for these designs were based on the iPhone 14 Pro Max screen size. I utilized various resources to create the graphic design system, including Google Fonts, Spark, Adobe Color, Material Design, and other online information sources. User interface is vital in meeting user expectations, as the program’s design plays a huge role in its functionality and overall appeal. FIX FIX FIX

### Impression Test

In order to conduct an impression test for my newly-designed Rides page, I created a two-part survey using Usabilityhub and invited a friend that fits within the target user demographic to take the test. The test-taker recorded her screen and audio commentary while going through the survey, as well as submitted her feedback for the site to compile. The first part of the survey included a 5 second impression test, where my Rides page was displayed to the test-taker for only 5 seconds before asking for a description of what she remembered and what purpose she thought the application could serve. The second part of the survey included a design survey, wherein the test taker was provided with contextual information about the application and was allowed to reference the Rides page while providing feedback. Questions were focused on understanding what design elements the test-taker liked and disliked, as well as what emotions she felt in interacting with the page. In this way, I was able to see what a potential user’s first impressions of the page might be, as well as gain specific feedback on whether the look and feel of the page’s design fit the larger intention behind the application.

#### Observations
Overall, I was quite pleased with how the impression test and design survey went. Within only 5 seconds, the test-taker was able to identify that the Rides page was part of an application that combined ride sharing with other functions. She also was able to identify the two different options for Carpool and Commute Group functions, demonstrating to me that separating them out into different boxes was the right choice with regards to page design, as the two separate boxes allowed her to quickly determine that there are two separate options for Rides. In addition, I was also pleased to see that she made the connection between application purpose and the color scheme being geared towards Earth-toned, fresh colors. This also contributed to the feeling of calmness that the test-taker reported feeling, which was important to me to develop, as test users in previous assignments noted that sustainability efforts tend to feel high-stress and pessimistic. Lastly, the test-taker noted that the icons and their respective labels, as well as the text descriptions, allowed her to feel a sense of excitement and confidence in reviewing the page — she noted that she felt like these design components allowed her to feel “the opposite of frustration” in knowing what to expect. However, she did note that the Title font might look too sharp for the application. This sharpness is because I chose a combination of serif font for the headers and san serif font for body text in my final typography iteration. In this case, one fix might be to pick a serif header with less “sharp” features, or potentially to abandon the mixed aesthetic and pick a sans serif font for the header as well. Ultimately, however, I was very satisfied with how the final Rides page performed in both the 5 second impression test and the design survey questions.

### Cognitive Walkthrough

The Cognitive walkthrough was conducted during class. This was incredibly insightful, as my peers had been working on similar projects and knew exactly what to look for when assessing my own application. I demonstrated the various tasks and walked the participants through each action. The participants then free-roamed around on the application themselves and commented any constructive feedback they had on the figma prototype page. 

Key takeaways/Things to improve on:

* One button did not fade upon hovering, whereas the rest did.
> *Solution: Fix this error by altering the hover interaction on the button to change into the faded variant.*
* Although my high fidelity prototype passed all of the color contrast checks, one user mentioned that a few colors on one page looked a little too similar in darkness/value.
> *Solution: I widened the range of contrast between the two colors to address his concern*

All these evaluations allowed me to alter and eventually perfect my prototype to the version shown above.

## Conclusion and Refleclection

This class served as my first experience into the fields of UX research and design. This course covered UX design methods, including ethnographic field research, persona-scenario development, information architecture, interface design, prototyping, and usability testing. Through hands-on practice in a human-centered process, I learned how to understand users, how to design interface and interaction for users, and how to evaluate and communicate user experience design. Being new to the space, this class provided me with lots of new experiences, as well as development in many useful hard and soft skills. I learned how to work on github, employ research and evaluation methods such as usability tests and heuristic evaluations, conduct impression tests, design graphic models/interactive high fidelity prototypes in figma, and utilize resources such as Material Design, color contrast, google fonts, etc.

If I had more time, I would focus heavily on the User Experience portion of the design process. I would conduct more usability tests, and focus heavily on methods of contextual inquiries. This would provide me with more insight into the mind of the user, and allow me to better design a system appealing to all demographics within my target audience. I would have preferred taking this course in a semester system environment, as the 10 weeks felt like a flash. However, I do appreciate the strict time constraints native to this course, as it forced me to work quickly and efficiently, preparing me well for any deadlines I will have to meet in the workplace. 

Although I do not intend to pursue a strictly UX/UI occupation, the skills I learned and developed in this course will be invaluable to the career I do want to reach in life. I am a mechanical engineering major and entrepreneurship minor. I hope to later pursue a career involving engineering product development at a start-up or small firm that prioritizes social innovation - in particular, within the sustainability sector, which is an interest that has been fostered by my love of nature. This course provided me with valuable foresight into the product design process, one I will have to replicate in the workplace of engineering product development. Furthermore, this current pitch assignment is extremely relevant to my future, as when I become an engineer, I will have to present my ideas to a larger audience and persuade those around me. 

I believe I was successful in achieving the following objectives and outcomes listed on the syllabus. These objectives include: applying a human-centered-design process, evaluating a user experience design and elaborate related theory and principles in the context, conducting user research in qualitative methods, conducting usability evaluation in quantitative methods, creating user-friendly, easy to use, and accessible (WCAG 2 AA) graphical user interface design, developing interactive prototypes, documenting the design decision-making process, and presenting the creative user experience design 

I loved taking DH110 and am eternally grateful for the knowledge and skills it has provided me with. This course helped fill the gap of knowledge left by my fields of study and has done well to prepare me for my career outside of academia. I am extremely thankful for Dr. Sookie Cho and the class TA for their continued guidance throughout this course.
