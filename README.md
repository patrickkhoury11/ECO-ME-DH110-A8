## Introduction / About this Project

This quarter's goal is to create a UX product that promotes one of the [17 Sustainable Development Goals](https://sdgs.un.org/goals) outlined by the United Nations. These 17 goals were adopted by all United Nation Member States and built on decades of work by countries and the UN, including the [UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs](https://sdgs.un.org/).  

The first step in any design process is to identify a problem. I did this by surveying the United Nations website, listing any goal I felt passionate about, and researching the current system in place to combat existing issues and reach the aforementioned goals. I felt strongly about Goal 11, Sustainable Cities and Communities, and could not find any existing comprehensive systems in place to combat . FIX THIS ONE

According to the United Nations, cities occupy just 3 percent of the Earth’s land, but account for 60-80 percent of energy consumption and 75 percent of carbon emissions. Inequality and the levels of urban energy consumption emissions are sprawling all suburbs all over the world.This has become such an issue that 9 in 10 people living in urban areas worldwide were breathing air that did not meet the World Health Organization’s air quality guidelines. By choosing to act sustainably, we choose to build cities where all citizens live a decent quality of life, and form a part of the city’s productive dynamic, creating shared prosperity and social stability without harming the environment. The cost of implementing sustainable practices in place is minimal in comparison with the benefits. For example, there is a cost to creating a functional public transport network, but the benefits are huge in terms of economic activity, quality of life, the environment, and the overall success of a networked city. All these issues facing sustainability will eventually affect every citizen. Inequality can lead to unrest and insecurity, pollution deteriorates everyone’s health and affects workers’ productivity and therefore the economy, and natural disasters have the potential to disrupt everyone’s lifestyles.

Traditional solutions to user involvement in sustainability efforts are all spread across different platforms that attempt to promote and inform environmentally-conscious actions. A myriad of options are available to users, but are difficult to utilize efficiently. For example: Facebook Marketplace exists for the purpose of helping individuals and businesses sell items locally, including used furniture and clothing. Clothing swap and thrifting applications like Depop and Poshmark exist primarily for the purpose of finding new homes for the items users once treasured and giving someone else's old treasures a new, happy home. The Green Globe program works with consumers, companies and communities to create sustainable corporate industries. Waze Carpool offers services where they provide rides for people to carpool with others in the area that are heading to similar destinations. Limitations with the current solutions include pervasive issues with visibility, efficiency, convenience, and high barriers to entry. Recent consumer insight research demonstrates that the public cares more about environmental issues now than ever before and feel personally affected by climate change. This growing increase in concern is stifled by a marked gap between aspirations and action, especially with those under age 30. 

My design would improve upon these issues by serving as a single platform to access these services, thereby addressing the gap between aspiration and sustainable actions by mitigating the aforementioned issues with services being spread across different platforms. Instead of having to sign up for a great many applications and jump between different platforms, barriers to access will be lowered by having this project as the one application that is the convenient, go-to for multiple services. With my centralized application, users will be able to more efficiently gather the information necessary to make informed, sustainable choices and pursue action with less time and energy spent searching for them. Furthermore, there is little education involved within these platforms, as the services themselves are sustainable, but users are not informed on the purposes behind these practices. My design will consolidate and improve on the aforementioned services while informing the consumer on sustainability practices. Finally, the single platform will also function as a social media application that allows users to expand upon their sustainability practices by joining a like-minded community and viewing events local to their area and that their friends and family express interest in attending.

## Design Statement and Community Contribution

This project will promote efficiency and convenience for user sustainability efforts by consolidating a variety of environmentally-conscious activities and services into one mobile application, presented as a social media platform. The aforementioned activities and services would be geared towards target users’ needs and daily lifestyle; for example, including carpooling, thrifting/clothing swaps, furniture repurposing, sustainability events, etc. In this way, my project will mainly support users in gaining an environmentally-conscious community and lowering barriers to access for information about related activities and services.

Based on the research I have conducted in the initial stages of this project, I believe that incorporating the following two key design features will mitigate the three barriers to sustainable living, as defined by previous interview subjects. The barriers are defined as:

* **Time:** “The world is full of a lot of people that are trying to do good on behalf of the environment but unfortunately are really busy. Having an intentionally sustainable lifestyle is something that takes up a lot of time to coordinate and keep going.”
* **Access to information:** “Lots of information about sustainability is tied up in academia and is not as accessible to the public, so it's more effort than it should be to learn about some of these issues and what the public can do to mitigate them.”
* **Inconvenience:** “People like buying clothes and other items and having to find a way to cut down on that can be off-putting.  When you're thinking about how to get from point A to point B and do it in a way that's good for the environment, it's difficult to bike or walk everywhere. If you need to get somewhere fast, a lot of the time driving is the best option. Ultimately, I think it's hard to try to be sustainable in a world where all of our systems and tools are more geared towards continuing the status quo.”

The two following features bring potential solutions to these barriers:

* **Consolidation:** Consolidating a variety of environmentally-conscious activities and services into one mobile application is far more convenient and time efficient for the users. This feature also mitigates the issue I identified in my previous evaluations stating the privacy concerns of the user. Users often don’t want to sign up their private information to multiple different service providers, as it makes them more likely to be susceptible to information breaches. This rids the user of the aforementioned concerns, while also creating a more time-efficient and environmentally-oriented product. Consolidating several environmentally-conscious activities into one platform allows for the opportunity to educate the consumer about sustainable practices and events, as the platform dedicates itself to the notion of sustainability and sustainable living in cities and communities.
> *Target user input on consolidation: “I would definitely prefer having one platform with multiple aspects and resources because it’s more convenient and time efficient to have everything in one place. I think with having one platform dedicated to sustainability also, I would be more inclined to remember to incorporate sustainability practices into my life because there’s now a platform where that’s the main focus.”*


* **Social-Media/Community Aspect:** Presenting the application as a social media platform directly pertains to the targeted demographic of secondary students and young adults with professional careers aged 25-29. Social media usage has increased nationally by almost 1000 percent in eight years (2005-2013) for people between 18 and 29, according to findings from the Pew Research Center. More than 98 percent of college-aged students use social media, says consumer insight service Experian Simmons. In addition, an annual nationwide survey of college students by UCLA found that 27.2 percent of students spent more than six hours on social media a week in 2014, up from 19.9 percent in 2007. 
* The targeted users make up the vast majority of individuals utilizing social media. These individuals actively seek activities and ways to be connected. Presenting the app as a social media platform incentivizes target users to be environmentally conscious, promotes activities and sustainable brands, allows for information to be presented to users, connects people who are existing or potential friends, and so much more. This feature stemmed from the recommendation of an interviewed target user.
* Users would have a profile page and the option to follow their friends and others. The app could employ ads from various environmental awareness brands, which would help generate revenue. This would aid both the brands (who are in support of sustainability) and the app itself (which would donate portions of its revenue to sustainability practices). Allowing location while the app is in use may allow for the details of relevant environmental activities in the user's area to be shown, encouraging the target users to go out and participate with their friends. These events may include but are not limited to beach cleanups, planting trees/gardens, and making/distributing sustainable products. Gofundmes, petitions, and other non time-draining commitments will also be available on the app.
> *Target user input on Social Media/Community based aspect: “I think to me, I would like to see information being made more accessible to the general public in terms and have an effort made to promote education around this topic. I also really would like to see a community aspect incorporated into the platform so that users can get in touch with people around them that are also interested in sustainability. And I think my last essential would be for the platform to have an optimistic point of view. I think that it’s easy to get really pessimistic really fast about the future of the planet, and I would hope that an application geared towards helping people become more sustainable has a more positive outlook on the future and help us with the steps we can take to get there.”*

## UX Storytelling - User Personas & Scenarios

UX storytelling is a vital process within an iterative and holistic approach towards human centered design. Through patterns that I have discovered in the aforementioned sections of analysis, I have gained compelling insights that will aid me generate ideas and build prototypes to improve the design and functionality of my product. It will allow me to shift my perspective into that of the user and clearly communicate their critiques and desires. Furthermore, it will allow me to filter any biases I may carry subconsciously, as instead of basing these functions on my own ideas, I am basing them off the suggestions from my targeted users. 

During my research, I created two personas based upon
